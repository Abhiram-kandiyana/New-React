        "body":"So, Rachel calls me and tells that she needs a break from us and that made me very upset. I thought that this is going to end with rachel and I was angry, confused, frustrated and went to garb a drink. As I was on my 20th beer I saw a girl hitting on me. She comes to me and asks if I wanted to dance with her. Though I nod out of it she forces me and takes me to the dance floor. The next thing I know I woke up in her bedroom naked. Now. How can I explain Rachel that I wouldnt do this if I hadn't thought that we were breaking up",
